# fileLock--Linux-and-Windows
C++ class code that collects File Lock operations under one class for Linux and Windows operating systems. Both sides use different library headar files for this job and their logic is different from each other, so it needs to be developed. The code in this repo is mostly for basic use. I'm waiting for your help.
